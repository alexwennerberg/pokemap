# pokescript

An SDK for writing bots that play Pokemon, and an associated bot itself. (WIP)

## Dependencies 
pyboy: https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy

Get a BootROM and copy of pokemon blue "legally"

## Configuration and running

Use the WARP_SPEED env variable to speed up the game. WARP_SPEED = 1 is normal speed. I think this can go up to about 16.
