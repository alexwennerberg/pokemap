# Pokemon AI

A WIP bot that is able to play pokemon. Not much progress so far, just simple i/o and some partial parsing of the Pokemon map

## Dependencies 

Using an older version of mooneye (because of https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb/issues/52), I wrote an interface that allows me to push buttons and increment the frames one at a time, as well as control the speed -- use the WARP_SPEED env variable.
